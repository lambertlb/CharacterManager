# CharacterManager
Management tool for creating and maintaining D&amp;D characters

This is mainly an experiment with using a dynamic language like python for managing configuration systems. It show how a dynamic language can be used to create a system where the configuration data and it's schema can be easily enhanced without the need of changing any base code. The code for doing this is in the configurator folder. See the README file there for explanation.

It also shows that by using PySide that user interface items can also be added dynamically to support new data and schema.
