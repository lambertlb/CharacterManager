# Builder files
This folder contains file used by and created by the PyQT builder. All the .py files are either created by the builder itself or by running the convert.sh shell script.

**DO NOT EDIT THE PYTHON FILES DIRECTLY AS THEY WILL BE OVERWRITTEN**

Instead edit the python file in the views folder that includes them.
